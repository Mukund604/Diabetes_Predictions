## Introduction

The code uses the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict diabetes based on certain features provided in the dataset. It includes data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation of the model's accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`. It contains information related to diabetes and various associated features.

## Installation

To run this project:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Mukund604/Diabetes-Prediction.git
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries mentioned in the code.

## Usage

Run the script `diabetes_prediction.py` or the Jupyter Notebook containing this code to execute the diabetes prediction model. Adjust the file paths or configurations as needed.

## Files

- `diabetes_prediction.py`: Python script containing the code for diabetes prediction.
- `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for diabetes prediction.

## Results

The accuracy achieved by the Naive Bayes model on the test set is printed to the console.
